Question 1: What authentication scheme is used by default in Django Rest Framework's browsable API? How is this managed?
Session authentication is used bu default. It is managed through the use of Django's authentication middleware and the 
SessionAuthentication class 'rest_framework.authentication.SessionAuthentication'

Question 2: What authentication scheme is used by httpie when querying with the -a or --auth option flag?
Basic authentication. It provides the username and password as part of the HTTP request headers

Question 3: What is the difference between Session Authentication and Token Authentication? How is Token 
Authentication an improvement over Basic Authentication?
Session Authentication relies on server-side sessions and cookies, while Token Authentication
involves the use of a token (typically a long string) transmitted with each request. Token Authentication
is considered an improvement over Basic Authentication as it doesn't require sending the actual username
and password with every request, providing better security and avoiding the need to store sensitive 
credentials on the client side.

Question 4: Provide a high level summary of what happens during an OAuth2 authentication flow. 
For instance: bitbucket.org > Log In > Log in with Google. What happens when I click "Log in with Google"?
When you click "Log in with Google", it initiates an OAuth2 authentication flow where Bitbucket requests 
authorization from Google to access your user information. After your consent, Google provides Bitbucket 
with an access token, to authenticate you without directly handling the Google credentials.
